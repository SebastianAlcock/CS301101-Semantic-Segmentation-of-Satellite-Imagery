#### CS301101 - Intro to Data Science; Semantic Segmentation of Satellite Imagery

##### Using Google Colab, we followed the instructions for NNI through the link given (https://nni.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sharings/nni_colab_support.html) It is also worth noting that we used some additional code for an easy access link, though this does not affect the outcome of the code whatsoever.
##### By creating and running a config.yml file we were able to produce our UI web page with our own title and using the .py files supplied by the seed repo given. We did not clone the other repository as it had many unnecessary files in it.

### Successful Launch of NNI UI:
